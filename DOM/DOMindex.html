      Sometimes when writing paragraphs, words appear and form sentences. It
      seems pretty weird to me but only if I think about it for way too long.
      Its kinda like when you repeat a word over and over in your head and that
      word starts to sound like garble. Then that leads me to begin to wonder
      who even chose the name's of words in the first place? That is my kind of
      job. When i grow up, I want to be a certified "Word Namer."
